# üõí E-Commerce Database Project üõçÔ∏è

This project is a comprehensive database system designed for an e-commerce platform. It efficiently manages critical components such as **customers**, **products**, **orders**, and **payments**, ensuring smooth business operations. The database is built with a focus on **data integrity**, **efficiency**, **scalability**, and **security**.

---

## üåü **Features**

- **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistency through well-defined relationships using primary and foreign keys.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized queries for fast data retrieval and transaction processing.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support business growth with easy integration of additional features.
- **Security**: Protects sensitive customer and transaction data with structured access controls.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Database Schema**

The database consists of the following tables:

1. **Customers**: Stores customer details (ID, name, email, password, address).
2. **Products**: Stores product details (ID, name, price, stock quantity).
3. **Orders**: Stores order details (ID, customer ID, order date, total cost).
4. **OrderItem**: Links products to specific orders (ID, order ID, product ID, quantity).
5. **Payments**: Stores payment information (ID, order ID, payment method).

## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Prerequisites**
- MySQL or any SQL-compatible database management system.
- Basic knowledge of SQL queries.

### 2. **Database Creation**
Run the following SQL commands to create the database and tables:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ECOMMERCEDB;
USE ECOMMERCEDB;

-- Customers Table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Customer_Name VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(50),
    C_Password VARCHAR(50),
    C_Address VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Products Table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Product_Name VARCHAR(50),
    Price INT,
    StockQuantity INT
);

-- Orders Table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    TotalCost INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);

-- OrderItem Table
CREATE TABLE OrderItem (
    OrderItemID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Orders(OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);

-- Payments Table
CREATE TABLE Payments (
    PaymentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderID INT,
    PaymentMethod VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Orders(OrderID)
);
```

### 3. **Insert Sample Data**
You can insert sample data into the tables using the provided SQL scripts in the project files.

## üîç **Sample Queries**

Here are some example queries to retrieve data from the database:

1. **Retrieve All Customers**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customers;
   ```

2. **Retrieve All Products**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Products;
   ```

3. **Retrieve Customer Order History**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       Customers.CustomerID, 
       Customers.Customer_Name, 
       Orders.OrderID, 
       Orders.OrderDate, 
       OrderItem.ProductID, 
       Products.Product_Name, 
       OrderItem.Quantity, 
       Orders.TotalCost
   FROM 
       Customers
   JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
   JOIN OrderItem ON Orders.OrderID = OrderItem.OrderID
   JOIN Products ON OrderItem.ProductID = Products.ProductID
   WHERE 
       Customers.CustomerID = 1;
   ```

4. **Retrieve Product Sales Report**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       Products.Product_Name, 
       SUM(OrderItem.Quantity) AS TotalUnitsSold
   FROM 
       Products
   JOIN OrderItem ON Products.ProductID = OrderItem.ProductID
   GROUP BY 
       Products.Product_Name;
   ```
